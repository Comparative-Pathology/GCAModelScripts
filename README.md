GCA Model Image Processing Scripts
==================================

Various small image processing scripts used with Gut Cell Atlas models.
Most of which are probably written using Python and probably use PyWoolz.

   * GCAExtractColonPath.py - extracts the colon path from a Woolz segmented colon domain.
