# GCA Model Image Processing Scripts

Various small image processing scripts used with Gut Cell Atlas models.
Most of which are probably written using Python and probably use PyWoolz.

  * GCAExtractColonPath.py - extracts the colon path from a Woolz segmented colon domain.
  * GCAXY2SplineIndex.py - creates a single Woolz object in which the values are the spline index values corresponding to the x, y coordinate values in coordinate value objects.
  * GCAMapHuBMAPSampleDomains.py - computes the 3D spatial mapping of a HuBMAP Large Intestine sample to a HuBMAP (v1.1) large intestine model.
